## The Diskcopy Firmware
The disk copy firmware is for mass copying CC floppy disks and is still being worked on
### How does it work?
You copy the files taht will go on the floppies to /Diskcopy/files/
then run 'start' in /Diskcopy/ then it will start copying files
It also needs to be connected to the floppies over modem so it shows up as a directory
### What benefit do i get?
Not having to manually wipe floppies and copy the files
### How to install?
Run ```
wget run https://devbin.dev/raw/dctetv8e
